function xi = xi_KB (K, B)

  %% Usage:  xi = xi_KB (K, B)
  %%
  %% Calucalates the a priori expected value of the entropy (xi)
  %% in the prior of the form:
  %%    P[Q]~ dQ/Q Q^{B/K}
  %%
  %% In:
  %%   K -- cardinality of the distribution support set;
  %%   B -- B/K extra samples is added to each possible outcome, must
  %%        be the same dimensionality object as K.
  %% Out:
  %%   xi -- expected entropy; same dimensionality as K.
